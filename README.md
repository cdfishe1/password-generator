## Deployment

Site deployed at [Charles Fisher](https://cdfishe1.github.io/password-generator/)

## Scope of Project

* Used ES6 features such as const and let for variable declaration and arrow functions to enhance readability of the script.
* Constructed script so that no variables or arrays are left in the global scope.
* Refactored html and css to reflect semantic elements.


## Installation

Deploy the html file and assets folder that contains the images, css, and javascript files on a website host server.
